# CartificialIntellegence
Part of CarMax 2022 Data Analytics Showcase

Note: The CarMax internal data is NOT INCLUDED in this repository

This project was designed to find hidden patterns between the appraisal data of a customer's car and the type of car that the customer ended up buying, so that some sort of recommendation algorithm could be developed to recommend CarMax customers' cars based on data about their appraisal.
